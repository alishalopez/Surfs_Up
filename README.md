# Surfs Up
## Overview 
We were sought after to do an analysis of temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii  in order to gauge whether a surf and ice cream shop would be a sustainable business year round. When investing money, it is important to gather data and look at trends when moving forward.
 
## Results
We chose to analyze June and December as key months and look into their summary statistics to see what the weather was like at two completely different times of the year

### June Weather Statistics

* Average Temperature = 74.94
* Max Temperature = 85.00 
* Min Temperature = 64.00

### December Weather Statistics

* Average Temperature = 71.04
* Max Temperature = 83.00
* Min Temperature = 56.00

## Summary
Looking at the statistics for the months of June and December alone, it is clear to see that they are fairly similar. This offers peace of mind for investors as there seems to be consistent weather year round. With June only being a couple of degrees warmer, surfing and ice cream should still be a popular choice among tourists and natives.
